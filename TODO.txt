TODO list, descending priority, keep it quick
=============================================

- *flow chart* starting from program initialization, starting from high level of reactions/data flow in m,v,c

- split model, view, and controller into separate files as originally intended

- get test data files for each component

- write tests based on data files

- detail logical structure of each of m,v,c in Dia
    - ... <--> {data} <--> [component] <--> {data} <--> [component] ...
    - differentiate between data requests and data sends?
    - actually, do this as a flow chart.  i like flow charts.


#FINISHED, :r !date followed by the task, as cut

- update architecture section of readme with choices in dia diagram, and choices made in code construction so far.
    - uri field in tulip node sent to rdflib to query
    - rdflib retrieves, parses, adds to model, and sends an rdflib Graph()
        - not a tlp.Graph(), the model should be visualization-independent
    - window is created for the new graph, the contents are made pretty
    - the displayed tulip graph is very much a part of the controller, since it is the structure that the user uses to choose queries and update the view
    - user selects node(s), shortest path to aggregate calculated by tulip and they are added to aggregate to maintain single-graph property
    - node selection observer adds to aggregated view
    - upon window close, all unselected nodes and edges are removed from model
        - just leave the unselected triples in the model.  history is important, and we have disk storage natively in rdflib

- describe overall program flow in dia as a flow chart
